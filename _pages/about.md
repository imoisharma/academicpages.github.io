If you have a question about my article, either post on the Kaggle/Medium or any other source media contact me via my [Email](mailto:imoisharma@icloud.com) address. **I do not respond to work emails sent to my personal email**.

Iâ€™m a Data Science Practitioner. Currently studying Masters of Data Science from [Monash University](http://www.monash.edu/pubs/2019handbooks/courses/C6004.html). I also have a computer science degree from the [Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University of Delhi](http://www.ipu.ac.in/Pubinfo2019/Admission2019mian/adm2019notices/adm2019NoticeMain.htm). My personal research in which I am interested in learning neuroscience and how to build more robust model using deep learning in neuroscience. I'm especially interested in how human brain works , and how population of neurons evoking in human brain inside cerebral cortex helps in reconstructing speech.

Here are some of the things I'm up to these days:
* I tried to write one article explaining one concept of Data Science each Sunday at 9:00 AM AEST and read more articles and innovation in the field of data science each saturday at 9:00 AM AEST (it's more interesting than it sounds, I promise!). You can also join me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) 
* I has been working on past 4+ years on the programming languages. Mohit Sharma has done several projects in Machine learning and deep learning. He has been working on Python, R, Tableau, Microsoft Excel and VBA, and Big Data.
